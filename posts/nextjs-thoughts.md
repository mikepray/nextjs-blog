Here's my thoughts about **Next.js**:

 -Server-side templating is still a powerful and useful idea. 
 -The nature of the Internet infrastructure, especially CDNs, significantly shapes the structure of the framework. What happens when that changes?
 -Deploying it to Vercel was trivially easy. It feels like cheating. I still feel like I have to get it running on an Ubuntu droplet before I can say I've *mastered* it, although this is probably fallacial.
 -I get anxiety when using Next.js and other JavaScript frameworks. Without having the docs in front of me I get a feeling that I don't know what is possible. Example: the `getStaticProps params` object. Maybe that will change as VSCode gets smarter.
 -All documentation should be written and stored in Markdown.
